# Entitas 2D Roguelike

This is a rewrite of the [Unity 2D Roguelike Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial) using [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp).
Entitas is an Entity Component System which allows projects to be architected in a clean and extendable manner.
